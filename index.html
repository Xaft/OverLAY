	<div align="justify"><b>ABOUT</b><br /><br />Many disciplines of science routinely generate series of 2D images (videos) - time-lapse images or spatial stacks. These videos are extremely rich in information, which, in return, is extremely difficult to efficiently communicate to the audience. Generic or proprietary media file formats and players lack the tools that an interested reader would need to access such information.<br/> <br/> 
    Just to name a few: <br />
    <ul>
    	<li> these videos often contain two or more, simultaneousy recorded channels which are color-coded, yet, there is no way to separately view them in a media player</li>
        <li> any markup placed on the video (e.g. an arrow to indicate a point of interest) permanently burns the underllying image content</li>
        <li> movies play with a constant speed and forward. Pausing them, moving to a given frame and playing around this frame to better inspect an event is nearly impossible</li> 
    </ul>
    
    <br />
    To overcome these limitations, I started coding an image viewer/video player that facilitates better appeciation of image data with ease of use and contributes to data accessibility, exchange and thus scientific  discussion.<br /><br />
    <b>What is OverLAY</b><br /><br />
    OverLAY is a script that runs in a web-browser and it can parse an appropriately prepared folder or a .zip file to load multi-channel image sequences with a non-destructive graphical overlay. It allows play-back of these sequences with user-defined speed and also enables stepping through the sequnce frame-by-frame. Users can <br />
    <ul>
    	<li>zoom globally and magnify locally</li>
        <li>toggle channels</li>
        <li>toggle the overlay</li>
        <li>adjust the speed of playback</li>
        <li>step through the sequence using the progress bar, the keyboard arrows of even the mouse scroll</li>
    </ul><br />

    Best way to learn about OverLAY is to try it, see some <a href="examples.html">Examples</a>!<br /><br />
