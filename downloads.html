     <b>Current version</b><br /><br />
	  The current version of OverLAY is <a href=OverLAY_0.1.zip>0.1</a>.<br /> This is the first beta version intended for public trials. There are quite a few known issues - many more to be discovered - and plenty of features still awaitng implementation.<br /> If you overcome any of the former or have ideas of the latter, please contact me: Imre Gaspar (imre.gaspar at embl.de, xafties at gmail.com).<br /><br />
      This <a href=OverLAY_0.1.zip>zip</a> file contains all the necessary files and a tiny example. Extract the files to a folder on a web-server (as I mentioned earlier, it could be the <em>public</em> folder of your Dropbox account) and you are good to go!<br />All script files are source files, thus if you feel like modifying the code (e.g. implenting another type of overlay), please feel free to do so! Just read the <strong>Legal disclaimer</strong> first! (Pretty short, basically it states that this is a free stuff and should stay that way)<br /><br />
      <b>Changelog</b><br /><br />
      basically the entire code<br /><br />
      <b>Known bugs/issues</b><br />
      <ul>
      <li>As all images (all frames and all channels) are stored as 32-bit RGB, OverLAY is a memory-hungry script. This may cause performance issues on computer with limited amount of RAM. </li>
      <li>Possibly related to this, there might be random frame jumps during playback. I could not trace this behavior to any part of the script, thus it seems, that the underlying processing.js interpreter and/or JavaScript engine is responsible for this.<br />
      For some reasons, though, clicking on the progress bar resolves this issue - this is an even bigger mistery to me.<br /></li> 
      </ul>
      <b>Functions to be implemented</b><br />
      <ul>
      <li>Support of 8-bit grayscale images with color look-up tables<br />
      This may ease the memory dependence of the script and also will allow adjusting the brightness/contrast of individual channels</li>
      <li>Tools to support rapid-quantitative anaylsis (length, angle, area, intensity etc.) of the image<br />
      This is why I decided to store the resolution values in the overlay.xml file (<em>dimensions</em> tag) 
            </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Previous versions</b><br /><br />
      There are none yet.
